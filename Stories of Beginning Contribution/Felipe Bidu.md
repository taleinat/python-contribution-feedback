I'm Felipe Bidu and I've been a Python developer and member of the Brazilian Python community for a little over 6 years now.

I saw your post about experiences on contributing to Python itself and want to share my experience. Becoming a more active contributor is something that I really want! So far I've done only [small and trivial contributions](https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Afbidu). I follow the mailing lists, sometimes I share my thoughts there and I do browse around the bug tracker from time to time.

I think I'm yet to make a full contribution mostly because the codebase is really dense. I'm not a very experienced C programmer myself. I started reading 'CPython Internals' by Anthony Shaw, found it a really good book and I intend to use it as a guide.

I did try a core mentorship with Victor Stinner but I didn't get. I didn't try - or seen - any other such opportunities in a while but I've seen your posts on the mailing lists and thought about reaching out to you as well.

I'm also very interested on Carol Willing's documentation initiative. I had the opportunity to meet with her at Python Brasil 2019 and she seems like a wonderful person. I do enjoy tech writing so I figure it will be a good opportunity to contribute more!

All in all, as my twitter bio jokling says, I'm a Python evangelist at my social circle. Be it on my local college, work, friends in tech & science and so on, I'm always pointing out how Python can be useful for them and I really do hope I'll be able to make a full contrib to the language itself on the future!

Feel free to use my answer as you'd like and to reach out if you need more details on something specific.
