A simple one: Created a patch in
[<span class="underline">https://bugs.python.org/issue31184</span>](https://t.co/u98cevUdsB?amp=1),
nobody has yet given feedback. Not a problem, but my first experience :)
Not sure if I should have added tests or written a PR on Github. I could
have written tests, but this was just a first iteration.
