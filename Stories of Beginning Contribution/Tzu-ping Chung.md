My first meaningful contribution (IIRC) was not as smooth as I’d like
either. I hit a bug while working with msilib, which let me to a
[10 year old open ticket](https://bugs.python.org/issue1104) (at the time).
The issue already had a patch attached, core developers seemed to like it,
but felt it should also address an (only loosely related IMO) memory
issue. I took the patch and created a PR, and also addressed the memory
issue. Nothing. Finally Steve Dower discovered the PR and merged it
another two years later.

Of course my example is only another data point, and there’s no
guarentee this is actually how the majority of contributors got. But I’d
venture to guess that at least for lesser-used modules, it is usual for
patches to require unporpotionally long waiting times, since they
receive little attention in the first place, and generally require more
back and forth since the code is much less viewed as wildly-used ones.
